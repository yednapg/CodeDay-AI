If you do come with a team, make sure to disclose any pre-formed work to the judges. Working together in a team can be fun, but it's also ok to work solo. Judges will take the size and experience of each team into account when deciding on prizes. Is CodeDay a "hackathon"? - CodeDay is a great way to learn coding, meet new people, and have fun. It's not a traditional hackathon, but it still offers plenty of opportunities to learn and grow. Attendees can expect to have a challenging but rewarding experience, with no prizes or swag, and no business plans or pitch decks. It's great for those who are newer to coding, and for those who just want to have a good time. Where can students sleep? - It's important to get enough rest during the event! Most students will sleep either under or around their desk, but you're welcome to sleep anywhere else in the venue that can be easily supervised by staff.
