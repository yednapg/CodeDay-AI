NOTES:
What is the goal of codeday? - The goal of codeday is to attract creative students and get them so excited about how creative code can be, that they keep learning on their own. Can parents attend CodeDay? - For security reasons, parents are generally not allowed at CodeDay, except for the following two times: Kickoff (Saturday, 11am-12:30pm) Presentations and Awards (Sunday, 10am-12pm) Should we bring anything to CodeDay? - CodeDay is an event where students come together to create projects and learn new coding skills. It is recommended that students bring a computer with them, unless they have requested a loaner computer or Chromebook as part of their registration. For overnight students, they should bring a toothbrush and toothpaste, a sleeping bag, a pillow, and a camping pad if they have one. For students with desktop computers, they should bring a keyboard, mouse, monitor, headphones, a wifi adapter, and all necessary cables. Can you work on existing projects at CodeDay? - Yes, but only if you're ok with not competing for "Best in Show" and "Best in Class" awards. (You'll still be eligible for "Special Prize" awards.) How do I order supplies for CodeDay? - You can order supplies for CodeDay by writing email to team@codeday.org or ask Tyler or Gaurav. What kind of things can be made at CodeDay? - CodeDay is a great place to create anything you can imagine! You can make games, mobile apps, websites, electronics projects, and even non-coding projects like paintings and albums. You'll also have the opportunity to join an existing team if you're not sure what you want to make. Just make sure your project follows the Code of Conduct, which is usually a little less strict than "school appropriate." Can I come with a pre-formed team? - Do I need to? - At CodeDay, you don't need to come with a team, but you can if you want to. If you do come with a team, make sure to disclose any pre-formed work to the judges. Working together in a team can be fun, but it's also ok to work solo. Judges will take the size and experience of each team into account when deciding on prizes. Is CodeDay a "hackathon"? - CodeDay is a great way to learn coding, meet new people, and have fun. It's not a traditional hackathon, but it still offers plenty of opportunities to learn and grow. Attendees can expect to have a challenging but rewarding experience, with no prizes or swag, and no business plans or pitch decks. It's great for those who are newer to coding, and for those who just want to have a good time. Where can students sleep? - It's important to get enough rest during the event! Most students will sleep either under or around their desk, but you're welcome to sleep anywhere else in the venue that can be easily supervised by staff. Some venues may have one or more designated sleeping rooms, but this depends on the venue and final attendance estimates, so we won't know until the week of the event.
